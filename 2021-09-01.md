!A foldersystem based on hirarchial brtz volumes depending on extension.
case of unknown extension, store in other volume, likely to be larger, 


! would be amazing to be able to itterate over an old git tree and to recommit with new detales.

! wonder which format git would like the most for structured data, if csv, xml or something else..

! the sepparate extensiosn should probably be diffed with help of xEdit, i just wish
    xEdit could load cache in background and allow multiple instances opened rather than this several minute long load time.

    maybe if we look through the pascal source of x edit we could decouple cache from interface.

! is folder hirarchial sorting of plugins the only viable aproach? that is, to 
    we'd simply start from a folder, then itterate each and every esp and and move the folder accordingly 
    in  a straight line 

    wonder if we'd do empty x mod -> x,y,z
    that is mod using master x and z
    alternatives;

    for each mod name, create,npc,etc create a subfolder .. then we end uo with something like modname, mastername,mastername,mod
    bit wastefully though, 
    we know that each mod that has x moster requirements must have does masters, so it makes sense to atleast put master,master,master,modname.
    only issue is if we have any mod as with only master1,master2, but not master3 
    a profile including master1,master2,master3 could load the mod requiring master1,master2, hower, it's not suitable for 

    order is not relevant for the mod, it is relevant when building a folder tree, and this is therefore less relevant.
    a tabular table is probably way more interesting, where each master is a new column if nt exsisting, and 
    i'm thinking if sqlite or simply csv... 

    xcel would allow simplier transformation where no needing master is simply null...
    would allow filtering, it would be simple to make it in intellij, as long as i can itterate over each item, and put there entries
    could possible use csv 

! suggestion
    put both the solidstate drives in my maincomputer... as it has better slots and we can move the satadrives to the nas.. the nas is limited to maximum 1 more sata connection and possibly one as usb, but that's bit shitty..
    we could once initialisation is done with the nas, remove the graphics card, and then slot the solid state, 
    in there instead, leaving the smalest sata (100gb) (currently in this pc )and the smallest solid state (100gb) (currently in sabrinas laptop)
    thought is to first insert both 500gb replacement, and sabrinas os ssd solid state drives into current pc
    then clone the laptop os to one of the 500gb.
    
! currently have two docs for ide drives, should see if we can could figure out the powerpins, maybe we could google for it simply

!items of zero weight and zero value should automatically be considered quest items

!the auto store script should recalibrate it's zero weight list each time you call it
that is, if you alter an items weight, it should recognize it

!any light armour with zero armour should be classified as a underarmour.
?can recepie ingridients be replaced with a list entry rather than a ingridient?

how does oblivionScript differ from pascal?

!CraftingCategory + modName

!breakdown recepie from craft recepie
!craft recepie from repair list (item weight/component~weights, recursive add till atleast all items used)

!replace versions of armours such as crafted metal helmet etc, to simply produce the vanila helmet
    this to make recepie compatibility more seamless

!join helper inventories with yours
    !join all helpers inventories
        !join helpers inventories with mass storage

!join mass storage with Crafting bench (see rbx)

!weaponModbench for simpler weapon modding, 

!replace text in field of mod, and save as override into other mod.

!replace any field, with a fuzzy match, with any entry of typ x with fuzzy match (for example ghouls to swampfoks)

!Must have NonConflicting Nvse Mods PerAutomatik

!RecepieHoarding PerAutomatik (make any recepie mod, work together)

!compare Two folders where atleast 1 is git, 
    assume relationships to files based on coolate(HasCommonPathName,HasCommonRelativepathName,HasCommonChecksum,HasCommonSize,HasCommonExtension)
        use git's built in mv function to rename and move current repo to mirror referenced folder, commit 
        and then merge against the other folder (alternatively, keep new files, overwrite left to right, delete right, delete left(move repo to right), delete and hardlink)


!find error records, if not overwritten, create override, with empty record if suitable, otherwise underriding non error record, alternativly select common record from similar plugin field.

!container to invetorie, containertolvllist

!for example bottle rinse repeat, why does it have it's own misc items adding to the list of possible flasks 

!compare two lvllists, for example save only does as a separate overide.
    !replace one lvllists ref with another

    !scrapper is correct with alcohol increasing damage treashhold, but not health recognize
    jswayer is correct on raw meat having a separate affect rather than just health regen

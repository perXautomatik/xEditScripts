Things to handle: ignoring deletions, treat as single entity, priority, linking

Ignoring deletions:
When applied to an element, ignore deletions in any of its children elements.
-- boolean set to rcore
-- leads us to not call "delete elements if missing"
-- passed to HandleArray

Treat as single entity:
When applied to an element, any change in that its children's values leads us to copy the entire element to replace the destination element.
-- boolean set to rcore
-- rcore made into a function that returns true whenever a change occurs
-- rcore doesn't call CopyElementValue when a value is different, simply returning true instead
-- HandleArray also made into a function that returns true whenever a change occurs
-- Array handlers return true when they detect an element has been added/deleted/changed

Priority:
Overrides load order on a per-element basis.  When priority for an element in a record in a file exceeds the priority of the same element in other files we use that element in destination record.  (remove?)

Linking:

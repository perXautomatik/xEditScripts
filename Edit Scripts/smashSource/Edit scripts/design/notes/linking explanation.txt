1. we have a set of plugins
2. each plugin has a smash setting
3. each smash setting has a definition for certain records
4. each record definition has a node for each element
5. we can link a node in a record definition to another node

--

If a element's value changes in a record in a file, and another element is linked to that element, the element that's linked will be copied from the record we're processing to the patch (if it exists).

TES5EditScripts
===============

TES5EditScripts is a collection of several scripts written in pascal 
which allow for the execution of useful functions for the editing and 
creation of Bethesda plugin files.  These scripts were developed with 
TES5Edit in mind, though many of them work fine in other versions of 
xEdit as well.  These scripts will allow you to save huge chunks of time 
when creating mods for Bethesda games.

Script Installation and Usage
==================================

To install scripts you need to put the .pas files and all associated asset 
files into 

  {Skyrim Directory}\TES5Edit\Edit Scripts\

From there you can execute the scripts from within TES5Edit, or another 
version of Edit which supports them.  Executing scripts in Edit is easy, 
if the script has a process function you'll start by selecting the objects 
you want to apply the script to, right click on one of the objects, and 
click apply script.  Choose the script you want to apply from the dropdown 
list and click OK.

If the script doesn't have a process function you can simply right click 
anywhere and apply it.  You can see individual script documentation for 
further instructions.

script that simply overwrite current entry with entry of chosen mod.

or overwrite a propperty by that mod, i think for example that handloader has made some excelent ammo categories

making such ruleset would make it very easy to autoresolve mods.
ammo list from frequency
nif from bouncing breasts.
    !maybe reading a json or csv with simple statements such as "bouncing breasts.esp, femal body" on one row.
 
    
!thinking that you might remove every recepie whom has cost 1 scrap metal etc.

! we don't need to name all recepies the same, rather we can make there editorId the same, seems like this is irrelevant for the usage




and wouldn't want any other categroeis to be assigned.

a mod removing conditions, as i regret assigning them all will nilly

dump mod content as json, then reread it, with eather the formid, or by entry name, alternitvly, resolve errors by looking for entry name.
    this would be a super easy way to port mods between game versions.
    external resolve table, like trye resolving with entries

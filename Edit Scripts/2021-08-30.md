generate replace lists by comparing original to overwriting values in relevant pluggins
like Fyty lootable junk vs fo3 and fonv
then we won't need to mess with all conflicts of for example interior projects.

ownership overhaul - vs fo3 fnv

the pluin shuould simply read overwriting or reference, and ignore if no overwring happens


filter where not overwrten by x
suitable for situations where you would want to overwrite from a plugin but not where another pluin has priority
this is overcours possible to overcome by simply overwrite and the see if the pluin in question needs to overvrite back

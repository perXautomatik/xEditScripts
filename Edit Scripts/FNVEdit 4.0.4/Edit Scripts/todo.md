replace recepie name with output, if only one 1 ressult.


the replace mod is good, cold incoreprate min or the other way arround, bet we need a universal interface instead of prompts


Some recipes is indeed dissensambling, such procedures does return parts enough to renensamble same item, with schematic atached, rqueiring atleast 1 prestine copy of said item
guns, armor some misc items.
some recepies is breaking down, which is ireversable and ressults in no schematic.
    food to fertelizer
    casings to brass,
    bottles to class
    chemical processesis
    cooking
    processing of raw leather

magasines and books have a chanse to grant you a recepie for apropiet recepie. (or raather, every book and magasine contain 1 recepie according to lvl list but does not grant sellable schematic if already known)
books and magazines spawn in qualities (requiring you to be below the treshold to increase your stat)
(for dummies) 20-40
(for begginers) 30-50
(A course) 40-60
(B course) 50-70
(For advanced) 60-80
(Master course) 70-90
(complete works) 80-100

the avaialable recepies in each book is in accordance with skill dificiulty.
How does convient crafting utelize the "dummyMagazin" and "dummyAlcohol"? is it a failed atempt or does it work in practise?
one alternative could be a script generating a weightless itemcontainer, that is called say dummyAlcohol, which can be crafted with, and consumes a random item of type when leaving inventory
autoapear as long as you have such item, and for the sake of compensating big batch crafting, keep a 
some recepies should be possible to ask vendors of such, allowing you to ask the making of them if you have such an item in your inventory and the mercahnt has such an item in there list.
lower lvl magasines should provide acces to base components, such as destilled spirits, homebrewn flamerfuel, gunpowder from fertelizer and nuke, etc.
such recepies that's not possible to get from dissensambeling objects.

get statistics of where items occur and through what, say 1 lvlist, referenced at one cell, is so seldom that i might remove it.
but the goal is to make sure that most of the items from most mods is avaialable evenly distributed among settlers, npcs, vendors and raiders
some skill magasines is less intitivly related to crafting, and i was thinking that say;

sneaking mags; 
                poison (at chemestry), 
                balistics such as dart guns (at workbench), 
                throwing knifs (at workbench)
                other ninja shit,
tumblers today;
                alternative recepeis to make bobby pins  <- requiring progressivly less tools to make
                    for example from steel scrap.
                        then from scrapmetal
                        then from cans
                        finally from bottle capps

mele fighting; (hand to hand /did it include meleweapons in general?)
                crafting of hand to hand weapons
                    excluding highly advanced such as the powersfist etc.
                if including general mele, include all improved meleweapons.

                doctorsbag
                    bracersers

                    auto-inject (stimpacks)

                gunmods

completing of conflicting or incomplete datasets could be seen as a resolving and merging of "binary sets"

binary sets is basicly a number of statements saying for example x > y, x != a a ~ y 

we could convert a numbered set into a such a set. that is, loop over it, concluding such as above, where ~ could be used if the number is not diverging more than a configured marginal.

this would allow us to for example, use old numbered data such as last.fm profile exports, per_automatik + konsturktor_k + spotify listening statistics + ipod statistics.

the revolutionary part of this, is that you preserve the "information" you listened more to trac x than track y, without staring yourself blind at the share number of plays.

as no other set of data could rival my konstruktor_k but some of the positioning in it could be questioned, and this sort of model could help us identify such dicrepencies.

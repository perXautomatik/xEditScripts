!what's needed: a jypiter notebook interface like where you can trace progress of your goals 
    for example 
        goal: replace all ghouls to swampcreatures
            stattus: npcs 0% 
                    create: 50%
                    spawnpoints: 100% 
            
        should allow you to put conditions like if spownpoints 100% then 100% all.

        goal: weight of bottle caps, 0.01,
            status: 0%
                current: 4.00

    
        all outoupdating, as soem the things could be done dynamically be scripts, it would require that a dll listen to the stats during run.

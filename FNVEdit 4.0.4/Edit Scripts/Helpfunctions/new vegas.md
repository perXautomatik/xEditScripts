crafting bullets should require atleast a mold,

dissensamble bullets, craft mold if atleast 1 bullet or atleast one casing.
use mold to melt brass to casings.
use flamer fuel and hotplate.

1 flamer fuel per 100 casings consumed.

input output ratio depending on finished bullets weight difference, that is, in procentage a heavier bullet would nead a more riggid casing.

or create a brass mill, container, simply changing state empty or full if enough casings is in itt.
allow you to pick it up or put items in it.

craft eather powecell or flamerfuel consuming.

idea, instead of container use a weapon item, so that one could "fire" it to produce new bullet casings... 
that is, cenvert casing x into xWeight brass
pick upp brass mill blaster, select amuntion type, fire it untill you run out of eater brass or flamerfuel
then we'd need to figure out how we make a gun consume two different amuntions, we could use a effect script, counting like practise makes perfect
taking resource as you fire.. or should we simply process any ammo, and output selected ammo, na feels bit to lazy.

Centralize content lists and containers

pascal script standardisation

such as inteface for filtering
output methods
finding records of relevance.

handling ressult options, such as ovreide or overwrite.

i think the scripts can call eachother, the quetion is how do they pass objects between eachoter.


the spareparts list from Mantainance X should be used as mod recepie ingreds, as they're to simple otherwise.

i love the consept of the mantainance mod, but does it take in consideration the condition of the item?

all the dissambling recepies should add you a receoue not to reensamble the item


dissensambling recepie should be a exact copy of the ensambling recpy except that the 
we could use condition, like dissensambling only allowed if 
if items it no less than 75% condtion, you are allowed to break it down.
becase otherwise what stops you from dissensambling it and rensambling it in perfect condition.

part of mentainance is of course to tighten and clean parts, but atleast sometimes you will need replacement parts.

we need a new dissensambling system not walling of recepies by repair numbers, but requiring you to break the item down,
and or buying a recepie before you can rensamble the item, and the repair number should affect your successrate and or part harvesting success.

we could use a condition system on parts, if we utelise weapon categorie for the parts rather than misc items or ingridents.

we could allow partial, or modular builds, with parts, checking, if grip, if pipe, if trigger then fire bullets.
this would be a very very ambitious system however..

i was just very fund of the fo4 weapon dissensambling system.



i think it is rather convinient that the mentainance mods only add a script adding the mod parts 
to the items relevant.

wonder if it would be so easy to just make a script, adding a recepie entry into a container.
then randomly take items out of the continer depending on quality of initial item.
one could add scrapmetal or other waste resorse instead so it's not a process of space saving.

having items such as tools and or cleaning substance could increase your chance of harnessing all parts.


add firewood as recepie requirement dynamically based on it's name, say x steak, x steamed, etc etc, so that it does not care about conflicts and mod depending


-Per Mod- generate Fomod folder with xml file inside listing record types, conflicting with, bsa or other folders
